# Apologetic Proofs
Dr Jacobus Erasmus is a Christian philosopher of religion who often gives talks on the topic of apologetics. I have written this mobile app for him to help the audience follow his talks and be able to digest the content afterwards. Furthermore, as a budding apologist, it is helpful to have apologetic content on your mobile device.
