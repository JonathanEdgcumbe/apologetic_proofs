                "your faith</i>. In First Peter 3:15, the apostle Peter commands all Christians " +

        addBlockQuote("In your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared" +

                "The apostle Jude, like Peter, says that it is crucial for " +
                "the Christian faith to be defended. In Jude 3-4, he writes:");
