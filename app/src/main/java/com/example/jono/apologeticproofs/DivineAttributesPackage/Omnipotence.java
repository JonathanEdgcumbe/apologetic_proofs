        addNormalText("The next attribute of God is that He is omnipotent. The term “omnipotent”" +
                " comes from the Latin words <i>omnis</i>, meaning “all,” and <i>potentia</i>, " +
                "meaning “powerful.” Thus, to be omnipotent means to be all-powerful.<br>" +
                "<br>" +
                "Now, Scripture clearly ascribes this all-powerful attribute to God by calling " +
                "Him <i>Almighty</i>. Furthermore, God’s almighty power is demon strated in His" +
                " creation of the world.  At the moment of creation, God created the universe " +
                "out of nothing; there was no material substance that God simply reshaped into " +
                "the universe, rather, God brought the universe (or all space-time, matter, and " +
                "energy) into existence out of nothing. But to create a universe out of nothing " +
                "requires unimaginable" +
                "power. Indeed, it seems difficult to conceive of a greater act of power than " +
                "this.<br>" +
                "<br>" +
                "But Scripture also teaches that God <i>can do all things</i>. In Matthew 19:26," +
                " for example, Jesus remarks to his disciples: “with God all things are possible.”" +
                " Therefore, according to Scripture, God is all-powerful.<br>" +
                "<br>" +
                "But what, exactly, does it mean to be all-powerful? Does it mean that God can " +
                "do absolutely anything, including that which is logically impossible? No it" +
                " does not. Traditionally, theologians have held that omnipotence should not " +
                "be understood as the ability to do absolutely anything because there are two" +
                " things that God cannot do, namely, God cannot contradict His own nature, " +
                "and God cannot do the logical impossible. Firstly, God cannot act in ways " +
                "that are contrary to His nature. For example, God cannot sin (such as lie or" +
                " commit adultery), nor can God cease to be a loving God. As Hebrews 6:18 tells " +
                "us, “it is impossible for God to lie,” and James 1:13 says, “God cannot be " +
                "tempted with evil.”<br>" +
                "<br>" +
                "But secondly, God cannot do things that are logically impossible. By the" +
                " phrase “logically impossible” we mean those things that are nonsensical, " +
                "contradictory, or simply absurd. For example, it is logically impossible for" +
                " God to make a round square, or to make a married bachelor, or to bring it " +
                "about that you exist and do not exist simultaneously. In fact, these things" +
                " are not really things at all. There is no “round square” or “married bachelor.” " +
                "These are just combinations of words that together are incoherent and make no " +
                "sense.<br>" +
                "<br>" +
                "Thus, to say that God cannot do “things” that are logically impossible in no" +
                " way diminishes God’s power. So when Scripture talks about God being able to" +
                " do “all things”, this should be understood in the narrow sense that means " +
                "being able to do all things that an all-powerful being" +
                "can do.<br>" +
                "<br>" +
                "Now, understanding omnipotence in this way has two benefits. Firstly," +
                " it helps you respond to the paradoxes of omnipotence. We have all heard " +
                "these paradoxes. For example, the paradox of the stone asks, “Can God make" +
                " a stone too heavy for Him to lift?” If God can make such a stone, then" +
                " there is one thing He cannot do, namely, lift the stone. But if God cannot " +
                "create such a stone, then again, this is one thing that God cannot do. Either" +
                " way, it is claimed, there is one thing God cannot do and, therefore, God " +
                "cannot be omnipotent.<br>" +
                "<br>" +
                "In response to this paradox, however, you may simply answer,");
        addBlockQuote("An omnipotent God can move any physical object and, thus, He cannot" +
                " make a stone too \theavy for Him to move, since this is logically impossible." +
                " However, not being able to do the \tlogical impossible in no way diminishes " +
                "God’s omnipotence.<br>");
        addNormalText("Secondly, understanding the definition of omnipotence helps you " +
                "respond to the problem of moral evil. According to this problem, an " +
                "all-loving and all-powerful God can and would create a world in which" +
                " people choose not to harm others through immoral acts (such as murder," +
                " abuse, massacres, and criminal acts). In response, you may claim that" +
                " it is logically impossible for God to give human beings freewill and " +
                "make them freely choose what is good. God cannot <i>make</i> people " +
                "<i>freely</i> do things. God can either create a world with freewill " +
                "and with the possibility of moral evil, or God can create a world without " +
                "freewill and without moral evil. But since it is more loving to give persons " +
                "freewill (as opposed to forcing people to do things), God is perfectly good " +
                "and powerful, regardless of the moral evil we find in the world.");
